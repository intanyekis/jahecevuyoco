But that hasn’t stopped us from thinking about Sundays.</p><p>With training camp less than a month away, we’re asking one question about every player on Pittsburgh’s roster. We’ll kick it off today with the offense. Without further ado, let’s dive right in.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h2>Quarterback</h2><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Kenny Pickett</a>:</strong> How much growth in Year 2?</p><p>After being thrust into action suddenly with few starter’s reps in practice, Pickett showed consistent improvements as a rookie. He must improve in the red zone, where his completion percentage plummeted to a league-worst 39 percent and he took six sacks (third most) in just 13 games. It’s typical for young quarterbacks to struggle in the red zone, but it will be a critical area for the Steelers, who figure to lean on the run game and will be in plenty of low-possession contests.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Can a QB-specific helmet prevent concussions? Kenny Pickett (and others) are counting on it</p><p>via <a href=#>@TheAthletic</a></p><p>$12 per year sub offer ending in a couple of days <a href=#>https://t.co/gQXu7JyIe8</a></p><p>— Mark Kaboly (@MarkKaboly) <a href=#>June 27, 2023</a></p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Mitch Trubisky</a>:</strong> How will he provide value?</p><p>In a lot of ways, Trubisky is the ideal backup for the Steelers. He has 64 games of NFL experience (including 55 as a starter) and is more than capable of stepping in to manage a run-heavy offense if Pickett is injured. That veteran presence should also be beneficial even when Trubisky is wearing a baseball cap on the sideline. “Me and Kenny have gotten so close,” Trubisky said during OTAs. “I just want to help him in any way I can— a soundboard, an extra coach, extra eyes on the field.”</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>Steelers 'finishing up' extension for Trubisky, GM says</p></a><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Mason Rudolph</a>:</strong> Are there 64 NFL QBs better than Rudolph?</p><p>Evidently, the league believed so. After failing to find a backup job elsewhere in free agency, Rudolph somewhat <a href=#>surprisingly rejoined the Steelers</a> as the third QB on the depth chart. He has plenty to gain in the preseason, as those late-game reps could be his only game film to impress the Steelers — or another team that loses a QB to injury.</p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Tanner Morgan</a>:</strong> Does he have any shot at making the team? When Rudolph returned, Morgan’s chances of making the 53-man roster diminished considerably. The undrafted rookie out of Minnesota will need an injury or a trade to earn a spot.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h2>Running back</h2><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Najee Harris</a>:</strong> Can he carry over his success from the second half of last season?</p><p>Harris’ 2022 season was a microcosm of the entire team. Through the first eight weeks, he averaged 45 yards per game and just 3.34 yards per carry. But after the bye week, with a healthier foot and a more-decisive running style, he averaged 75 yards per game and 4.1 yards per carry. If the Steelers are going to lean on their running game, Harris will need to pick up where he left off.</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>The Steelers love Kenny Pickett, but will they open up the offense? Matt Canada says no</p></a><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jaylen Warren</a>:</strong> Will he become more than a third-down or change-of-pace back?</p><p>Warren came out of nowhere last year as an undrafted rookie to earn considerable playing time. He is a nice complement to Harris and is a reliable pass protector, which is ideal for his role on third downs. Now, on a team that <a href=#>made a promise to run the ball</a>, how much can he lighten Harris’ load?</p><p><strong>Anthony McFarland:</strong> Is this the year he makes the 53?</p><p>The Steelers have always had a soft spot for McFarland, who showed great breakaway speed and home run hitting potential in college. With last year’s third running back, Benny Snell, still unsigned, a door is open for McFarland to claim a regular roster spot. But he’ll have competition and might need to prove he can be a special teams contributor.</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>Steelers 53-man roster projection: Only 2 RBs?

A 5-9, 180-pound Morgan State product, Graham made the most of his rookie minicamp tryout. Now he’ll try to continue that trend and contend for the third running back job.</p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jason Huntley</a>:</strong> Stop us if you’ve heard this before, but can he contend for RB3? A fifth-round pick in 2020, the speedy 5-8, 190-pound back has just 18 career carries.</p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Darius Hagans</a>:</strong> Will a more physical body type — the Virginia State rookie is 6-foot, 210 pounds — be what the Steelers want for the third running back?</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h2>Fullback</h2><p><strong>Monte Pottebaum:</strong> Will the Steelers actually use a fullback?</p><p><a href=#>Long blond mullet</a>. A last name that will sound great in a Pittsburgh accent. And he grew up a Steelers fan? Pottebaum has all the makings of a fan favorite if he can carve out a niche. But the Steelers used a fullback on only 77 snaps last year, and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Connor Heyward</a> can dabble there, so his most direct path to the field is special teams.</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>'Monte the Mullet,' a QB and a kicker: Ranking Steelers undrafted rookies' chances to make the 53</p></a><h2>Wide receiver</h2><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Diontae Johnson</a>:</strong> Will 2022’s fluke correct itself?</p><p>Johnson <a href=#>set a “record”</a>, if you want to call it that, last season when he caught 86 passes without scoring a touchdown. But is that really his fault? How many times did the dink-and-dunk offense give him a realistic chance of scoring? Was he going to take an 8-yard out route to the house? No.</p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>George Pickens</a>:</strong> How much of a leap will Pickens take in Year 2?</p><p>With a jaw-dropping catch radius and a physical body type, Pickens proved he can be a big-play threat downfield. Now, the Steelers will need to put more faith in Pickens to go up and make plays if he’s going to become a breakout star. He’ll also need to continue to develop his route tree to become a more well-rounded weapon.</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>The George Pickens Show: The origin story of the freakish, eminently memeable rookie WR</p></a><p><strong>Allen Robinson:</strong> Did <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the “Khan Artist”</a> find another steal?</p><p>Steelers GM Omar Khan swapped seventh-round picks to acquire the versatile veteran, who is capable of running any route from any position. Robinson figures to claim the starting spot at slot receiver but could contribute in a variety of ways. The only question (and it’s a big one) is: How close to his 2015 Pro Bowl prime he will be at 30 years old?</p><p><strong>Calvin Austin III:</strong> How will he be used?</p><p>The 5-9, 162-pound, speedster appears well positioned for a slot role. Running back Najee Harris called Austin a “unicorn” and hinted there could be more up Matt Canada’s sleeve. “You can put him anywhere. In the backfield. At slot,” Harris said.” I think he’s going to be featured a lot.” Austin also should have a chance at the returner jobs.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Gunner Olszewski</a>:</strong> Can he earn his way back into the good graces of the coaching staff?</p><p>A camp darling last season, Olszewski later bobbled his shot at the return job and had little role on offense. Robinson and Austin add more competition, but the Steelers are still somewhat thin at receiver and will need someone to provide depth.</p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Miles Boykin</a>:</strong> Can he carve out a larger role on offense? Arguably the Steelers’ best special teamer last year, Boykin is a savvy veteran with a Notre Dame-educated head on his shoulders and a good familiarity with the AFC North.</p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Hakeem Butler</a>:</strong> Can he maximize what might be his last NFL chance?</p><p>Once a touted prospect in 2019, the 6-5, 227-pound receiver has bounced around the NFL, CFL and XFL. After playing well in the XFL, the big-bodied receiver will have a shot to make the Steelers and brings a different dimension with his freakishly long legs and stout frame.</p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jordan Byrd</a>:</strong> Can he claim a return job? At 5-9 and 170 pounds, the undrafted San Diego State running back is listed as a receiver. But the most likely scenario is he will need to earn his paycheck on special teams, where he averaged 24.8 yards per kick return and had four return TDs (three kicks and one punt) in college.</p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Cody White</a>:</strong> Can he crack the 53? After toiling on the practice squad for all but one game last season, White had a solid offseason. Maybe he can find a way to be the last receiver on the active roster.</p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Dez Fitzpatrick</a>:</strong> Can he make the team? After spending the overwhelming majority of his first two years in the league on the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Titans’</a> practice squad, he’ll be fighting for more than that in camp.</p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Ja’Marcus Bradley</a>:</strong> The former Cleveland Brown has played in just eight career games since 2020, bouncing on and off the practice squad. Will he have a similar role in Pittsburgh?</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Dan Chisena</a>:</strong> A former standout sprinter in high school and later at Penn State, can he be a surprise in camp?</p><h2>Tight end</h2><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Pat Freiermuth</a>:</strong> Can he ascend to elite?</p><p>Freiermuth ranked sixth among tight ends last year in receiving yards (732) and receptions (63), with 18 receptions and 237 yards on third down. On a team that will feature the tight end, can he take another leap to become a Pro Bowler in Year 3?</p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Darnell Washington</a>:</strong> Can he be a factor in the passing game as a rookie?</p><p>At 6-7 and 264 pounds, Washington looks like an offensive tackle and proudly calls himself a sixth lineman. However, he’s not the most polished route runner and doesn’t have the smoothest hips. He needs development to reach his ceiling. One thing to keep in mind: Canada loves to run tight end screens. It’s fun to imagine the “sixth lineman” running with blockers in front of him.</p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Zach Gentry</a>:</strong> Are his days as a Steeler numbered?</p><p>Gentry has shown his fun-loving personality and a possible future in acting as he’s made the transition from quarterback to blocking tight end. However, the Steelers now have a crowded tight end room. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Washington</a>’s addition will create competition for Gentry. He’s still likely to make the roster, but his future is murky.</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>Steelers draft winners and losers: Pickett, Harris get help, but some vets face trouble</p></a><p><strong>Connor Heyward:</strong> What position will he really play?</p><p>He’s still listed as a tight end on the roster. But with quality depth and varied body types in that room, Heyward could transition into an H-back role. His mother has already called him “Hybrid Heyward,” which feels like a nickname that could stick.</p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Rodney Williams</a>:</strong> In a crowded room, does he have any shot at the 53? Odds are against it. He’ll likely have to earn his time from the practice squad.</p><h2>Offensive line</h2><p><strong>G Isaac Seumalo:</strong> How much can he improve the unit?</p><p>Seumalo was arguably the Steelers’ most significant offseason addition and will immediately start at left guard. When <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Broderick Jones</a> gets up to speed, the rookie will benefit from an established veteran working alongside him. If the line — which looked like a weak link last preseason — becomes a strength, Seumalo will be a big part of the success.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><strong>OT Broderick Jones:</strong> How quickly will he become a starter?</p><p>“If you draft a guy in the first round, you’re not drafting a guy to sit him,” offensive line coach Pat Meyer said. “When he’s ready to play and we think he’s ready to play, the kid is going to play.” Jones has pedigree and an athletic skill set. However, he had just 19 college starts, and the Steelers will face several dominant pass rushers early. While I personally would like to see him start sooner than later, it could be reasonable to break him in more slowly.</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>Kaboly: Broderick Jones looks the part, but what's the rush to play him early?</p></a><p lang=en dir=ltr>Today, Broderick Jones celebrates his 22nd birthday.</p><p>Why the unexpected way he came into the world made Tawana Jones believe her “blessed child” was destined for something special.</p><p>“I didn’t think I wanted anymore kids.

His first challenge will be to <a href=#>hold off Jones as long as possible</a>. From there, Moore would appear likely to slide into a swing tackle role. But can he be more than that and ultimately wrestle reps from incumbent right tackle <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Chukwuma Okorafor</a>? Speaking of which …</p><p><strong>OT Chukwuma Okorafor:</strong> How much competition does he have?</p><p>According to Pro Football Focus, Okorafor was the Steelers’ lowest-graded offensive lineman (61.2) in 2022, allowing team highs in hurries (34) and total pressures (39). Typically, the right tackle needs to be a more dominant run blocker than the left tackle, where pass protection is the priority. Moore bulked up this offseason, which could help his cause.</p><p><b>C </b><strong><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Mason Cole</a></strong>: Can he help the line jell like last year?</p><p>The Steelers’ offensive line improved greatly during 2022, but they have made changes and can’t count on all five starters playing every game again. As the leader in the middle of the line, Cole (the group’s top-graded player by PFF at 67.1) will be a big part of that group meshing in camp.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><strong>G <a class=ath_autolink href=#>James Daniels</a>:</strong> Is his starting job written in Sharpie?</p><p>Daniels was a solid contributor last year, with the second-highest PFF grade (66.9) among Steelers linemen. If he stays healthy, he should be the starter. But there’s plenty of quality depth behind him.</p><p><strong>G Kevin Dotson:</strong> Can he find his way back into the lineup?</p><p>Dotson started all 17 games last year, but the numerous additions bumped him into a reserve role. Depending on what the Steelers are looking for, he may not have a helmet every Sunday.</p><p><strong>G Nate Herbig:</strong> Can he play like a starter again?</p><p>Herbig has stepped in for injured linemen and performed like a starter throughout his career. He may need an injury to get a chance, but he has upside and a bullying style that fits the Steelers’ plans.</p><p><strong>G Kendrick Green:</strong> Will he ever be active again?</p><p>After starting 15 games as a rookie in 2021, Green never saw the playing field in 2022. His competition for playing time is even stiffer this season. Maybe his days in Pittsburgh are numbered.</p><p><strong>OL <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Spencer Anderson</a>:</strong> Will his versatility open a door?</p><p>Considering the newfound depth, it won’t be easy for Anderson to earn a helmet on gameday. However, the rookie’s ability to play all five offensive line positions in college convinced the Steelers to spend a seventh-round flier on him.</p><p><strong>C <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Ryan McCollum</a>:</strong> Does the lack of competition at center help his cause? The Steelers have few linemen with experience playing center. If Cole is injured, maybe he can climb the depth chart. He might not be the first choice, but maybe.</p><p><strong>OT <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Le’Raven Clark</a>:</strong> Does he still have a place? When Clark was added in free agency, it appeared he had a spot as a swing tackle. But after Jones’ arrival, it’s worth wondering where he fits in a crowded room.</p><p><strong>OL <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jarrid Williams</a>:</strong> Can a career practice squad player turn into something more?</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><strong>G William Dunkle:</strong> Ditto. He shares a name with pro MMA fighter William “The 208 Underdog” Dunkle and will also be an underdog to earn playing time.</p><p>(Photo of Kenny Pickett: Gene J.
